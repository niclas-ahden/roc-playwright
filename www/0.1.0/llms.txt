### Playwright

BrowserType : [ Chromium, Firefox, WebKit ]

Description:
Which browser engine to use.

Description:
Timeout for operations. `NoTimeout` means wait indefinitely.

Description:
Handle to a browser instance. Returned by `launch!`.

Description:
A browser context with isolated session state.

Description:
A page (browser tab) where automation happens.

WaitUntil : [ Load, DomContentLoaded, NetworkIdle, Commit ]

Description:
When to consider navigation complete.

launch! : BrowserType => Result Browser

Description:
Launches a browser and returns a handle to it.

```
browser = Playwright.launch!(Chromium)?
```

Runs headless with a 30 second timeout. Use [launch_with!] for more control.

launch_with! : { browser_type : BrowserType, headless : Bool, timeout : Timeout } => Result Browser

Description:
Launches a browser with custom options.

```
browser = Playwright.launch_with!({ browser_type: Chromium, headless: Bool.false, timeout: TimeoutMilliseconds(60000) })?
```

Description:
Launches a browser with a ready-to-use page.

Description:
Launches a browser with custom options and a ready-to-use page.

Description:
Creates a new browser context with isolated session state.

Description:
Creates a new page in the browser context.

Description:
Navigates to a URL.

```
Playwright.navigate!(page, "https://example.com")?
```

Description:
Navigates to a URL with options.

```
Playwright.navigate_with!(page, { url: "https://example.com", wait_until: DomContentLoaded })?
```

Description:
Returns the page title.

```
title = Playwright.get_title!(page)?
```

Description:
Returns the text content of an element.

```
text = Playwright.text_content!(page, "h1")?
```

Fails if the element has no text content (is empty).

Description:
Returns the value of an input or textarea element.

```
value = Playwright.input_value!(page, "#email")?
```

Description:
Returns an attribute value from an element.

```
href = Playwright.get_attribute!(page, "a.nav-link", "href")?
```

Fails if the attribute doesn't exist on the element.

Description:
Clicks an element.

```
Playwright.click!(page, "button#submit")?
```

Description:
Fills an input or textarea with text.

```
Playwright.fill!(page, "#email", "user@example.com")?
```

Replaces any existing content. This is the fastest way to enter text.

> **Note:** For WASM apps that rely on keyboard events, use `press_sequentially!`
> instead. `fill!` sets the value programmatically and dispatches a synthetic
> `input` event, which some frameworks don't handle.

Description:
Types text character by character, triggering key events for each character.
Use this instead of `fill!` when the page has special keyboard handling (e.g., WASM apps).

```roc
Playwright.press_sequentially!(page, "#search", "hello")?
```

Description:
Moves the mouse to the center of an element.

Description:
Returns `Bool.true` if the element is visible, `Bool.false` otherwise.

```
is_shown = Playwright.is_visible!(page, "#modal")?
```

Returns immediately without waiting. Returns `Bool.false` for non-existent elements.

Description:
Waits for an element matching the selector to appear and be visible.

```
Playwright.wait_for_selector!(page, "#loading-spinner")?
```

Times out based on the browser's configured timeout.

Description:
Returns the number of elements matching a selector.

```
count = Playwright.query_count!(page, "ul.results li")?
```

Returns `0` if no elements match (does not fail).

Description:
Moves the mouse to the specified coordinates.

Description:
Moves the mouse to the specified coordinates with interpolated steps.
Use `steps` > 1 for drag operations.

Description:
Presses the left mouse button at the current position.
